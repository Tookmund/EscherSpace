-as you change your axis of orientation, set one of the awards (IMPRESSIVE) to 
a certain value (0 for on the ground, 1 on the right wall, 2 on the ceiling, etc).

use that value in bg_pmove PM_CheckDuck method to set the pm->ps->viewheight 
to the croucn viewheight when on the ceiling so all items are visible.

-make sure to disable all other uses of that award


make flags also spawn and be pickupable in TEAM games (holding a flag gives the power to toggle gravity)
